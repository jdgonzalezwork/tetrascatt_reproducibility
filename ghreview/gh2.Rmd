This is a non-exhaustive table with previously reported model parameter values. Large parts of the table are copied from Lavery et al. [-@lavery_determining_2007] and Lawson et al. [-@lawson_acoustically-inferred_2004].  

Some taxa are repsented more than once, where multiple literature recodrings have been found. It is recommended to throughly study the cited and other literature before using any of the presented values.  

It should also be noted that L/a values might be fluctuating largely due to:
  
  * geographical location [@kogeler_density-and_1987; @lawson_acoustically-inferred_2004]
* life history traits of the taxon or seasonality [@lawson_acoustically-inferred_2004; @kogeler_density-and_1987] 


g and h in some species have been reported to fluctuate with:  
  
  * temperature [@chu_measurements_2005] 
* size classes [@chu_measurements_2005; @lawson_acoustically-inferred_2004; @kogeler_density-and_1987]  
* depth [@chu_measurements_2005]   
* seasonality (for example due to changes in lipid content) [@kogeler_density-and_1987]
* state of the analysed individuals (preseverd or alive) [@kogeler_density-and_1987].

g and h are important variables in the model. It has been suggested that the effects of varying g and h can be of the same order of magnitude as the orientation [@stanton_average_1993].
